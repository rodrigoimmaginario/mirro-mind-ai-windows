## Commands

Claude Code uses the `/mm:` prefix. Pi and Gemini CLI use the `/mm-` prefix.
Codex uses the `$mm-` prefix. All runtimes call the same Python core.

## Runtime Self-Update

The `runtime` subcommands operate in three layers: inspection (read-only), backup (preparatory), and update (planning and execution). They were designed to be composed in this order before any code or database mutation happens. See [Runtime Repair Policy](docs/process/runtime-repair-policy.md) for the rules that govern safe repairs.

### Recommended flow

```bash
# 1. Confirm the runtime is healthy
uv run python -m memory runtime status

# 2. Classify any drift the status surfaces
uv run python -m memory runtime diagnose

# 3. Check whether a new version is available
uv run python -m memory runtime update --check

# 4. Plan the update locally
uv run python -m memory runtime update --dry-run

# 5. Execute the update through the safe pipeline
uv run python -m memory runtime update
```

Each command exits non-zero when state is not safe enough for the next step.

### Inspection

#### `runtime status`

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime status [--mirror-home PATH]
```

Reports version, repository, git state, mirror home, database, core migration health, installed extensions, extension health, clone role, Python version, and environment. Exits `attention needed` when the git tree is dirty, the mirror home is not configured, core migrations are missing or unknown, or installed extension migrations are pending, drifted, or unknown.

#### `runtime version`

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime version
```

Reports the installed version, repository, branch, commit, and clone role. Local and offline.

#### `runtime diagnose`

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime diagnose [--mirror-home PATH]
```

Classifies attention-needed drift into stable finding codes (`git_dirty`, `core_migration_pending`, `core_migration_unknown`, `extension_migration_pending`, `extension_migration_unknown`, `extension_migration_checksum_drift`, `extension_manifest_invalid`, `database_missing`, `mirror_home_missing`). Each finding carries severity, subject, recommendation, and a repair route. Read-only.

### Backup

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime backup [--mirror-home PATH]
uv run python -m memory runtime backup --verify PATH_TO_BACKUP.zip
```

Runtime backup archives contain `memory.db` and SQLite sidecars (`memory.db-wal`, `memory.db-shm`) when present. Verification is structural: the zip must be readable, contain `memory.db`, and avoid unsafe archive paths. Recovery is manual in this version: stop active runtime sessions, move current database files aside, extract the backup into the Mirror home, and rerun `runtime status`.

### Update planning

#### `runtime update --check`

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime update --check [--channel stable|main]
```

Queries the configured upstream branch through `git ls-remote`. May contact the network, but does not fetch, pull, change refs, back up, migrate, or modify files. Reports `up_to_date`, `update_available`, `local_ahead`, `diverged`, `no_upstream`, or `unknown`.

On the `stable` channel, this check remains intentionally conservative: it can know a remote commit is available, but it does not fetch release-note files. When release details are not already available from local refs, the output says so and points to the preview and update commands.

#### `runtime update --dry-run`

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime update --dry-run [--channel stable|main]
```

Plans an update from local refs only. Reuses `runtime status` as the safety gate. Reports whether a real update would be a no-op, pull known remote commits, or require manual reconciliation because the branch is ahead, diverged, dirty, or missing an upstream. Does not contact the network.

When the channel is `stable` and the local upstream ref contains release notes newer than the installed version, the dry-run shows a release-aware notice with version, title, digest, and the concrete preview/update commands. If release notes are unavailable locally, the dry-run falls back to commit-oriented wording.

### Release notes

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime release-notes [latest|vX.Y.Z]
```

Reads narrative release notes from `docs/releases/`. This command exists so runtime skills can answer natural-language requests such as "What's new in the latest Mirror Mind release?" Users do not need to run it directly.

### Release promotion doctor

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime release-doctor --target vX.Y.Z [--stable origin/stable]
```

Runs a read-only preflight before stable promotion. The doctor checks repository availability, clean git state, package version, release-note file and heading, release index link, release tag state, and stable ref relationship. It prints `pass`, `warn`, and `fail` checks. Warnings keep the command exit code at zero because a pre-promotion state may legitimately lack a tag or stable fast-forward; failures exit non-zero. The command does not fetch, tag, merge, push, edit files, back up, migrate, or modify refs.

### Update execution

```bash
uv run python -m memory runtime update [--no-fetch] [--skip-migrations] [--mirror-home PATH] [--channel stable|main]
uv run python -m memory runtime update --repair-updater [--no-fetch] [--mirror-home PATH] [--channel stable|main]
```

Executes the safe update pipeline. Stages run in order and the first failure stops execution:

1. **status gate** — must be ready.
2. **fetch upstream** — mutates only remote-tracking refs. Skipped with `--no-fetch`.
3. **plan** — accepts `none` (already up to date) and `pull`. Blocks `ahead`, `diverged`, and other unsafe states.
4. **backup database** — reuses the runtime backup pipeline.
5. **verify backup** — structural verification of the archive.
6. **fast-forward** — `git merge --ff-only` against the upstream. Refuses merges and rebases.
7. **migrations** — opens `MemoryClient` once to trigger migration application. Skipped with `--skip-migrations`.
8. **post-update status** — reruns `runtime status` and expects `ready`.

Failures print a recovery block with the backup path and previous commit when relevant. Successful installs that move to a new commit include an `Installed changes` summary generated from `git log <previous>..<new>`. On the `stable` channel, successful installs also include an `Installed release` block when the new checkout contains narrative release notes. The pipeline does not roll back automatically: recovery is documented manual work.

If the full status gate crashes before update planning, `runtime update` automatically falls back to updater self-repair. The repair lane uses a minimal safety gate: clean git tree, configured upstream, optional fetch, optional database backup when the Mirror home and database are available, fast-forward only code update, and migrations skipped. It then asks the user to rerun `runtime update` with the repaired updater. The same lane can be invoked explicitly with `runtime update --repair-updater`.

### Clone role

Each Mirror Mind clone declares its role through a `.mirror-clone-role` file at the repository root. Valid values are `production` and `dev`. The file is local to each clone and ignored by git. When the file is missing, unreadable, or contains an unknown value, the role defaults to `production`.

- `runtime status` and `runtime version` report the current clone role.
- `python -m memory build load <slug>` refuses to start Builder Mode in a clone marked `production` unless `--ignore-production-role` is passed.
- Production clones receive code through `runtime update`, not by direct development edits.

See [Runtime Repair Policy](docs/process/runtime-repair-policy.md) and [Decisions](docs/project/decisions.md#mirror-mind-clones-declare-a-role) for the boundary and rationale.

### Update channel

Each clone declares its update channel through `.mirror-update-channel`. Valid values are `stable` and `main`; missing, unreadable, or unknown values default to `stable`.

- `stable` is the user-facing release channel.
- `main` is the integration/dogfooding channel.
- A push to `main` is not a release.
- `stable` advances only through release promotion after versioning, release notes, CI, smoke validation, tagging, and fast-forward.

Change a clone to stable releases:

```bash
printf 'stable\n' > .mirror-update-channel
uv run python -m memory runtime version
uv run python -m memory runtime update --check
```

Change a clone to dogfooding/main:

```bash
printf 'main\n' > .mirror-update-channel
uv run python -m memory runtime version
uv run python -m memory runtime update --check
```

Remove the marker to return to the safe default (`stable`):

```bash
rm .mirror-update-channel
```

The local git branch and the update channel are related but not identical. A checkout may report `Git branch: main` and `Update channel: stable`. In that state, `runtime update` still compares and fast-forwards against `origin/stable`; the channel controls the update target even if the local branch name remains `main`.

For common channel problems, see [Troubleshooting](docs/process/troubleshooting.md#runtime-update-channel-stable-is-not-fetched-or-unavailable).

To list the active personas for the current user:

```bash
uv run python -m memory list personas --verbose
```

The database is the source of truth for personas. There is no authoritative
static table; `list personas --verbose` reflects the current seeded state.

## Configuration

`.env` is loaded automatically by `memory.config` at import time; values
already present in the real environment take precedence.

Two starter files live at the repo root:

- `.env.example` — minimal template (identity + API keys)
- `.env.example.advanced` — canonical reference with every variable documented

### Identity (CV4 user home)

| Variable | Default | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| `MIRROR_HOME` | (unset) | Explicit path to the user's mirror home. Takes precedence over `MIRROR_USER`. |
| `MIRROR_USER` | (unset) | Short user name; resolves to `~/.mirror-minds/<user>`. |

In production, one of the two must be set. Setting both is only valid when
they agree (`MIRROR_HOME` ends with the same user name).

**Legacy path compatibility.** The default container was renamed from
`~/.mirror` to `~/.mirror-minds` in 2026-05. When `MIRROR_USER` resolution
is used and `~/.mirror-minds/<user>` does not exist but `~/.mirror/<user>`
does, the legacy path is resolved and a one-time warning is emitted. This
is permanent supported behavior. To stop the warning, run
`mv ~/.mirror ~/.mirror-minds` once.

### API Keys

| Variable | Role |
|----------|------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Embeddings (`openai/text-embedding-3-small` via OpenRouter), extraction (Gemini Flash), and the multi-LLM `consult` command. |

### Environment Selection

| Variable | Default | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| `MEMORY_ENV` | `production` | One of `production`, `development`, `test`. Controls DB file name and gates `MemoryClient.reset`. |

### Path Overrides

All of these derive from `MIRROR_HOME` in production. Set them only to
override the default layout.

| Variable | Default | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| `MEMORY_DIR` | `MIRROR_HOME` (prod) or `~/.mirror-minds` | Runtime working dir for `mute` and `.bootstrap.lock`. |
| `MEMORY_PROD_DIR` | `MEMORY_DIR` | Production-only override. |
| `DB_PATH` | `<MIRROR_HOME>/memory.db` | Full SQLite path. |
| `DB_BACKUP_PATH` | `<DB_PATH parent>/backups` | Legacy alias for `BACKUP_DIR`. |
| `BACKUP_DIR` | `<MIRROR_HOME>/backups` | `memory backup` output. |
| `EXPORT_DIR` | `<MIRROR_HOME>/exports` | Markdown export root. |
| `TRANSCRIPT_EXPORT_DIR` | `<EXPORT_DIR>/transcripts` | Full-transcript export dir. |

### Runtime Integrations

| Variable | Default | Role |
|----------|---------|------|
| `PI_SESSIONS_DIR` | `~/.pi/agent/sessions` | Source directory for `backfill_pi_sessions`. Override for multi-user setups. |
| `MIRROR_SESSION_ID` | (unset) | Fallback session id for conversation-logger CLIs when neither `--session-id` nor a hook payload is present. Rarely set by humans. |
| `MIRROR_WELCOME` | (unset) | Set to `off`, `0`, `false`, or `no` to suppress the welcome card emitted by `python -m memory welcome`. See `docs/product/specs/welcome/index.md`. |

### Set by External Runtimes (do not set manually)

- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` — injected by Claude Code when it invokes hooks.
- Claude Code hook payloads carry `session_id` on stdin.
- Pi's extension passes the session file path to the logger CLI.

## Legacy Migration Workflow

> **Note:** This workflow exists for users migrating from Portuguese-era
> databases (pre-CV0). Most early users have already completed this migration.
> This section is a removal candidate for a future CV.

Use this when you have a Portuguese-era source database such as `memoria.db`
and want to migrate it into a user home.

### Supported Source Policy

Supported:
- clean Portuguese legacy databases

Rejected explicitly:
- already-English/current databases
- mixed Portuguese/English databases
- unsupported or ambiguous SQLite shapes

### Commands

```bash
uv run python -m memory migrate-legacy validate \
  --source ~/.espelho/memoria.db \
  --target-home ~/.mirror-minds/<user> \
  --report /tmp/mirror-migration-validate.json

uv run python -m memory migrate-legacy run \
  --source ~/.espelho/memoria.db \
  --target-home ~/.mirror-minds/<user> \
  --report /tmp/mirror-migration-run.json
```

### Safety Guarantees

- explicit source required
- explicit target home required
- source is never mutated
- target `memory.db` must not already exist
- no silent merge into an existing target
- `validate` performs no writes
- `run` copies first, migrates the copy, and verifies the result

Both commands support `--report PATH`. The JSON report includes: generation
timestamp, command mode, source and target paths, source classification,
source row counts, applied migrations, detected legacy columns/indexes/identity
layers, planned translations, and post-migration verification details.
