# About these Docs

This documentation is organized around four questions: what Mirror Mind is as a product, how the project is being built, how we work, and how to operate the system. Use the sections below as a map into the product principles, runtime specs, roadmap, development process, and operational reference.

## Project

How we are building it and why.

- [Briefing](project/briefing.md) — foundational decisions (D1–D8), architecture premises, glossary
- [Decisions](project/decisions.md) — incremental decisions and open discussions
- [Roadmap](project/roadmap/index.md) — CV → Epic → Story hierarchy with status

Current state: **CV0 English Foundation ✅ · CV1 Pi Runtime ✅ · CV2 Runtime Portability ✅ · CV3 Pi Skill Parity ✅ · CV4 Framework/User Separation ✅ · CV5 Multisession Safety ✅ · CV6 Runtime Maturity ✅ · CV7 Intelligence Depth ✅ · CV8 Runtime Expansion ✅ · CV9 Mirror Mind 1.0 🟢 In Progress · CV14 Stateful Extensions 🟢 E1–E2 Done**

Runtime expansion result: **Gemini CLI first at L4 full parity; Codex second at L3 parity through the wrapper script, JSONL backfill, `AGENTS.md`, and `$mm-*` skill invocation.**

## Product

What Mirror Mind is and how it behaves.

- [Product index](product/index.md) — map of product documentation

- [Expand and Collapse](process/expand-collapse.md) — the operating rhythm behind planning, delivery, and release
- [Versioning](process/versioning.md) — prospective versioning rule from CV9.E5 onward
- [Release Notes](process/release-notes.md) — narrative release-note format for future releases
- [Worklog](process/worklog.md) — operational progress (what was done, what is next)
- [Troubleshooting](process/troubleshooting.md) — known bugs in the wild, their root causes, and the fixes that addressed them
- [Runtime Repair Policy](process/runtime-repair-policy.md) — boundaries and routes for safe runtime repair and self-update
