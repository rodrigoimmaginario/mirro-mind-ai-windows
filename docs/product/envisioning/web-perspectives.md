# Mirror Web Perspectives

Mirror Mind 1.0 needs a web surface that makes the user's Mirror visible. The
surface should not feel like a database admin panel. It should help the user
stand in front of their Mirror with a chosen way of looking.

The current product direction is to model the web experience through
**perspectives**. A perspective is not a permanent user type. It is a viewing
mode over the same underlying Mirror data. Atlas and Workspace share Mirror
Core, but they do not need to share the same information architecture or visual
rhythm.

```text
same Mirror data
  identity
  personas
  journeys
  memories
  conversations
  tasks
  decisions

seen through different perspectives
  Atlas
  Workspace
```

The Mirror does not change when the perspective changes. The user's stance in
front of the Mirror changes.

## Product premise

Mirror Mind has at least two natural usage patterns:

- Some users approach Mirror as identity-first: identity, self-knowledge,
  personas, memory, recurring patterns, and long-term becoming are the primary
  value.
- Other users approach Mirror as work-first: journeys, projects, operational
  context, decisions, tasks, and continuity are the primary value.

The product should not split these into two separate products or force a user to
choose a fixed identity. The same person may need a reflective view in one
moment and an operational view in another.

The web surface should therefore ask a situational question:

```text
How do you want to look at your Mirror?
```

For Mirror Mind 1.0, the initial perspectives are:

```text
Atlas
  Explore identity, personas, memories, patterns, and conversations as a map of
  meaning.

Workspace
  Follow journeys, decisions, tasks, conversations, and useful context as a
  surface for action.
```

## Perspective behavior

If a user has not chosen a default perspective yet, the web app asks which
perspective they want to use. The choice can be saved as the default, but the
user can always switch perspectives later.

```text
Welcome to your Mirror

Choose how you want to look today.

└─────────────────────────────┘   └─────────────────────────────┘

[ ] Use this as my default perspective
```

Once inside the app, the active perspective remains visible and switchable.
The shell stays stable while the inner surface changes.

```text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Mirror Mind        Perspective: Atlas ▾       Search Mirror  │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Atlas content
  editorial psyche map

Workspace content
  analytical work dashboard
```

The common shell prevents the product from feeling like two unrelated apps. The
perspective controls the rhythm of the surface, not the existence of the Mirror.
Implementation should follow the [Web Surface Specification](../specs/web-surface/index.md):
web routes render typed surface read models instead of querying internal data
or composing meaning directly.

## Atlas perspective

Atlas treats Mirror as a map of meaning. It is for understanding what the Mirror
knows, how identity is structured, which personas are active, which memories
matter, and which patterns keep returning.

Atlas should feel editorial, spatial, and contemplative. Its primary
information architecture is a psyche map, not a sidebar. The user enters through
regions of meaning rather than through a list of administrative sections.

Primary question:

```text
What does my Mirror know about me, and where did that understanding come from?
```

Atlas map regions:

```text
Self / Identity
  structural layers that shape how the Mirror responds

Ego
  the active operational voice

Personas
  specialized lenses that activate by context

Memories
  retained meaning, facts, patterns, and evidence

Shadow
  tensions, avoidances, contradictions, and integration candidates

Journeys
  fields of becoming and work

Conversations
  raw trail from which memory, decisions, and patterns emerge
```

## Workspace perspective

Workspace treats Mirror as a surface for action. It is for understanding current
journeys, decisions, tasks, project context, and the conversation trail that led
to the current state.

Workspace should feel analytical, operational, and state-oriented. Its primary
information architecture is a dashboard. It should expose movement, blockers,
recent decisions, active work, and relevant context without becoming a generic
project-management clone.

Primary question:

```text
Where are we, what has been decided, and what should move next?
```

Workspace dashboard areas:

```text
Active journeys
  what is currently moving

Decisions
  what has been decided and why

Tasks
  concrete open work when tasks exist

Recent conversations
  operational trail that shaped the current state

Relevant memories
  reusable context for the active work

Context
  identity and persona material that affects how work should be interpreted
```

```

Example object interpretation:

```text
Memory in Workspace
  Why this matters to the current journey
  Related decisions
  Related tasks
  Related conversations
  Last used or referenced
```

## Shared object model

Perspectives should not duplicate data. They should change the presentation and
priority of the same objects. The product has one Mirror Core and two rhythms:
Atlas reveals meaning; Workspace coordinates movement.

```text
Persona
  Atlas: an internal lens of identity
  Workspace: a specialized operating mode

Memory
  Atlas: evidence of a pattern or identity claim
  Workspace: reusable context for action

Conversation
  Atlas: evidence and autobiographical material
  Workspace: decision trail and operational history

Journey
  Atlas: a transformation path
  Workspace: a project or active field of work
```

This keeps the product coherent: identity remains the foundation, but identity
is not forced as the only front door.

## Unity of experience

Atlas and Workspace should be fundamentally different in information
architecture and surface rhythm, but they should not feel like separate
products. Unity comes from shared structure beneath the visible differences.

Shared elements:

```text
Shell
  Mirror identity, perspective switcher, global search, local-first status,
  settings, and account/runtime affordances remain stable.

Object model
  Identity, personas, memories, journeys, conversations, tasks, and decisions
  are the same entities in both perspectives.

Detail grammar
  Clicking any object opens a familiar detail structure: title, description,
  relationships, evidence, and available actions.

Evidence pattern
  Interpretive claims remain traceable through the same "View evidence"
  affordance.

Design system
  Typography, spacing scale, card anatomy, radius, focus states, badges, and
  icons remain shared.
```

Perspective-specific variation:

```text
Atlas
  more spacious
  more editorial
  map-based IA
  larger regions
  fewer numbers
  deeper colors and symbolic accents

Workspace
  denser
  more analytical
  dashboard-based IA
  lists, tables, filters, and status cards
  more counts and operational state
  clearer neutral surfaces with pragmatic accents
```

The technical counterpart to this design unity is the surface layer: Atlas and
Workspace are separate read models over the same Mirror Core, not separate data
models. The web layer consumes those read models through the Web Surface API.

The design principle is:

```text
One Mirror, two rhythms.
Atlas reveals meaning.
Workspace coordinates movement.
```

## Evidence principle

Every interpretive claim should be traceable. When the interface says that a
memory, pattern, persona, or journey means something, the user should be able to
inspect the evidence behind it.

Initial evidence affordances:

```text
View evidence
  conversations
  source memories
  related journey events
  created or updated timestamps
  confidence or status when available
```

Evidence is not a separate 1.0 perspective yet. It is a detail pattern used by
both Atlas and Workspace.

## 1.0 scope hypothesis

The 1.0 web visibility slice should stay small enough to ship, while still
making the perspective model visible.

Possible 1.0 scope:

- First-run perspective choice when no default exists.
- Persistent default perspective setting.
- Perspective switcher in the web shell.
- Atlas home as an editorial psyche map with identity, personas, shadow,
  memories, conversations, and journeys in read-only form.
- Workspace home as an analytical dashboard with journeys, conversations,
  decisions or tasks when present, and relevant memories in read-only form.
- Object detail pages reuse existing data services where possible.
- Evidence links appear where source data is available, without requiring a full
  graph interface.

Out of scope for the first slice:

- Force-directed or fully interactive graph navigation.
- Editing identity or memory content.
- Automated perspective inference.
- Full evidence graph.
- Multi-user web authentication beyond the current local-first boundary.

## Open questions

- Should the default perspective be stored in the database, in the user home, or
  in browser-local state?
- Should perspective affect URLs, for example `/atlas/memories` and
  `/workspace/memories`, or should it be a query or session state over shared
  routes?
- Which objects already have enough provenance to support useful evidence links
  in 1.0?
- Are decisions first-class data today, or should Workspace derive decisions
  from journey docs and conversation metadata until a stronger model exists?
- Should Atlas have any persistent secondary navigation, or should navigation
  happen primarily through the psyche map plus search?
- Which Workspace dashboard areas are supported by current data strongly enough
  to ship in 1.0?
- What is the smallest manual validation scenario that proves users understand
  what is inside their Mirror?
