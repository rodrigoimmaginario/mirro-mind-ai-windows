# CV18.DS1 — Wisdom Voice

**Status:** 🟢 Implemented · awaiting Pi validation

**Placement:** First new voice in `v0.25.0 — Soul Mode More Voices`

**User-visible outcome:** A user can ask to hear Wisdom Voice during Soul Mode and receive a coherent ritual listening card.

## Why This Exists

The first Soul Mode release names a larger constellation than it can yet render. Wisdom is one of the voices the user can intuitively expect to hear, but it is not yet active.

Wisdom Voice is not a generic advisor. It lets the user's material be crossed by a situated idea from a thinker, philosopher, sacred text, ancient tradition, proverb, contemplative teaching, mythic image, or other relevant wisdom text. Inside the card, the source itself should speak in a solemn, ancestral register and unfold its own symbolism; Mirror's practical bridge to the user's situation happens outside the card. Wisdom Voice does not render a `listening for` section.

---

## Scope

- Add Wisdom Voice as an active Soul Mode listening lens.
- Include Wisdom Voice in Possible Listenings when living matter is sufficient.
- Render Wisdom Voice with the same ritual grammar as Self and Shadow.
- Add the prompt and command/service behavior needed for the user to hear the voice.
- Guide Wisdom Voice to cite a source when reliable and to avoid fabricated bibliographic precision.
- Preserve the rule that voice content appears inside the card under `the voice says`.
- Keep Mirror's bridge outside the voice card.
- Ensure Wisdom Voice does not mutate identity, journal, journey state, or project files.

---

## Non-goals

- No Wisdom fragment library.
- No Passagem curation.
- No advice engine.
- No closing integration rite.
- No psyche-layer enrichment.
- No identity mutation.
- No rich UI.

---

## Acceptance Behavior

Given Soul Mode has enough living matter, Possible Listenings includes Wisdom Voice as an available listening.

Given the user asks to hear Wisdom Voice, Mirror renders a Wisdom Voice listening card with what the voice says and what it is listening for.

Given Wisdom Voice responds, the card contains the voice of a relevant thinker, text, tradition, proverb, mythic image, or teaching when reliable, unfolds the source's image or symbolism in 5–8 compact paragraphs, omits `listening for`, and ends with a lapidary declaration rather than prescribing next steps.

Given the card has rendered, Mirror may bridge outside the card in its normal tone, connecting the source's voice to the user's concrete situation.

Given Wisdom Voice runs, no journal entry, identity entry, or project-state mutation is created automatically.
