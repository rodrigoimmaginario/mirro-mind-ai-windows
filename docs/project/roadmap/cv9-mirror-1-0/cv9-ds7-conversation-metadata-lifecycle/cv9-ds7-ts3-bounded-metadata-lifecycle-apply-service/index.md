# CV9.DS7.TS3 — Bounded Metadata Lifecycle Apply Service

**Type:** Technical Story  
**Status:** Validated  
**Parent:** [CV9.DS7 Conversation Metadata Lifecycle](../index.md)

---

## Intent

Provide the internal bounded apply service for conversation metadata lifecycle
decisions without treating the service contract itself as Navigator-facing User
Story behavior.

---

## Why This Is a Technical Story

The implemented behavior is internal substrate:

- `ConversationService.apply_metadata_lifecycle(...)` applies only explicit,
  safe metadata values;
- manual/user-edited title locks are preserved;
- `refine_candidate` decisions are skipped rather than auto-applied;
- dry-run behavior remains non-mutating;
- the method returns a changed/skipped report for future operation surfaces.

This is verified by automated service tests. It does not yet give the Navigator a
first-class operation route, so it should not close US2 by itself.

---

## Verification Evidence

- Focused service tests cover safe apply, manual lock preservation,
  `refine_candidate` skipping, summary/tags apply, and dry-run non-mutation.
- Full test suite passed after implementation.

## Relationship to US2 and US3

TS3 unblocks the operational User Story work. US2 remains open until the apply
capability has a Navigator-facing operation surface. US3 is the next proposed
User Story for that operation report surface.
