# CV9.DS7 — Conversation Metadata Lifecycle

**Status:** Active Delivery Story; expansion accepted  
**Source:** [ES-001 Conversation Metadata Lifecycle](../../../exploration/es-001-conversation-metadata-lifecycle.md)  
**Exploration summary:** [exploration-summary.md](exploration-summary.md)

---

## Delivery Story Seed

When a conversation begins and evolves, Mirror updates user-facing conversation
metadata through a lifecycle: title, summary, tags, and metadata state are
created, repaired, or refined according to per-field readiness rather than one
narrow retitle trigger.

---

## Why This Is a Delivery Story

This is not one implementable User Story. The Exploration handoff contains a
larger arc:

- lifecycle policy for title, summary, tags, provenance, confidence, readiness,
  and lock state;
- replayable validation over known conversation shapes;
- an observable dry-run or diagnostic path before mutation;
- later safe application in conversation metadata updates.

The Delivery Story expansion has been accepted. No implementation plan has been created yet; planning begins only after a child User Story or Technical Story is pulled.

## Validation Seed

Replay sample conversations with generic, meaningful, and scope-changing
openings. Verify title, summary, tags, metadata readiness/provenance, and
refinement behavior while preserving manual title locks.

---

## Boundaries

In scope for this Delivery Story:

- conversation title lifecycle;
- summary and tag readiness;
- metadata provenance, confidence, lock state, readiness, and update source;
- dry-run or diagnostic evidence before mutation;
- preservation of manual/user-edited title locks.

Out of scope for this Delivery Story unless explicitly expanded later:

- journey inference after conversation start;
- broad autonomous per-turn metadata intelligence before close-time and backfill profiles are proven.

---

## Execution Tracks

### Runtime Metadata Lifecycle

Goal: Mirror updates metadata intelligently as new conversations unfold.

Sequence:

1. [CV9.DS7.TS4](cv9-ds7-ts4-metadata-update-execution-profiles/index.md) — make execution profiles explicit.
2. [CV9.DS7.US5](cv9-ds7-us5-close-time-metadata-update/index.md) — finalize non-manual metadata at conversation close.
3. Later: first-exchange initialization and active refresh cadence.

### Historical Metadata Backfill

Goal: existing conversations become useful in the web surface.

Sequence:

1. [CV9.DS7.TS4](cv9-ds7-ts4-metadata-update-execution-profiles/index.md) — define safe/force semantics.
2. [CV9.DS7.US8](cv9-ds7-us8-historical-metadata-backfill-preview/index.md) — preview old conversations.
3. [CV9.DS7.US9](cv9-ds7-us9-historical-metadata-backfill-apply/index.md) — apply reviewed backfill with safe/force modes.
4. [CV9.DS7.US10](cv9-ds7-us10-web-historical-metadata-backfill-operation/index.md) — expose web preview/apply, resume scopes, production progress, and orphan cleanup.

## Follow-up and Debt

- Improve evidence term filtering/ranking for metadata lifecycle reports. Current
  `refine_candidate` evidence is useful enough for candidate signaling, but may
  include noisy tokens from paths, timestamps, or generic connective words.
- Debt ledger: [D-001 Metadata lifecycle policy and evidence filtering live inside ConversationService](../../../debt.md#d-001--metadata-lifecycle-policy-and-evidence-filtering-live-inside-conversationservice) was paid by TS2. Evidence term filtering/ranking remains a possible future improvement, but the policy boundary is no longer embedded directly in `ConversationService`.
