# Ariad Visual Progress Experiment

## Visual Grammar

Taxonomy cards:

- `🟪[CV9]` for Capability Value cards
- `🟦[E3]` for Epic cards
- `🟩[S18]` for Story cards

Ariad checkpoint states:

- `✓` done
- `◉` current
- `○` pending
- `✕` blocked

## Transition View

```text
Completed
🟩[S17] Fresh User Stable Update Smoke
Status: Done
Release: v0.9.0 — Self-Update Done

Integrated into
🟦[E3] Distribution & Tooling

Unlocked
- Stable self-update works from v0.8.0 to v0.9.0 in a fresh-user-shaped clone.
- Dogfooding now exposes the opening UX gap: users need to see release availability when they open Mirror.

Moving next

## Visualization Notes

- S18 is a follow-up story revealed by dogfooding, not part of the original S13–S17 release intent.
- Release Intent is emergent here: the story may become a patch release or remain unreleased until the next coherent arc.
- This is a useful example for Maestro: release visualization must support both known release arcs and post-release follow-up stories.
- Navigator decisions: 6h TTL is acceptable; remote welcome checks should be disableable; status bar should read cache only; welcome owns refresh; version inference can use remote tags while title uses local release notes when available.
