# CV9.E3 — Distribution & Tooling

**Epic:** Make Mirror Mind simple to install, configure, and grow into  
**Status:** ✅ Done — Self-Update Done track complete

---

## What This Is

CV9.E3 is the distribution and first-run experience epic. The goal is that a
new user can go from zero to a working, personalized mirror in minutes — not
hours — with no manual editing required before the first session.

The scope covers: the install flow, the initial identity bootstrap, the default
template quality, and the mechanisms through which a user's identity deepens
over time.

## Done Condition

CV9.E3 is done when the Self-Update Done condition is met:

- A new user can run `memory init <name>` followed by `memory seed` and have a
  working, personalized mirror without manual YAML editing before first use.
- Runtime status, diagnosis, backup, version inspection, update discovery,
  update planning, and safe update execution exist as documented CLI surfaces.
- Production and development clones have an explicit local role boundary through
  `.mirror-clone-role`, and Builder Mode refuses production clones by default.
- Runtime update execution is conservative: status-gated, backup-first,
  verification-backed, fast-forward only, and manual-recovery oriented.
- The welcome card shows the installed version and surfaces locally known update
  availability without contacting the network.
- Successful runtime updates summarize installed changes after the fast-forward.
- The updater has a code-only self-repair lane for status-gate crashes, so stale
  updater bugs can be fixed without asking end users to perform manual git
  recovery.
- Update channels distinguish integration (`main`) from user-facing releases
  (`stable`), and release notes are available through runtime surfaces and a
  Mirror skill.
- Channel switching, branch/channel differences, stable bootstrap, and common
  channel troubleshooting are documented.
- A first formal stable release is published with a version bump, narrative
  release note, tag, and stable branch promotion.
- Stable update notices and post-install output speak in release terms, while
  main/dogfooding updates can fall back to commit summaries.
- Release notes are accessible through natural-language runtime surfaces across
  supported runtimes.
- Stable promotion has a repeatable preflight/checklist or doctor.
- A fresh clone can update from an older stable release to a newer stable release
  without manual git intervention.
- `README`, `REFERENCE.md`, process docs, decisions, and roadmap entries reflect
  the onboarding and self-update flow accurately.
