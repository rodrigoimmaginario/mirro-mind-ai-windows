# Releases

Narrative release notes for Mirror Mind live here from the adoption of CV9.E5 onward.

Release notes are prospective. Historical versions through `v0.7.0` remain valid project history, recorded in Git tags and the [worklog](../process/worklog.md), but they are not retroactively reinterpreted by the new [versioning rule](../process/versioning.md).

Future release notes should use the structure defined in [Release Notes](../process/release-notes.md): digest, highlights, narrative context, what changed, conscious exclusions, lessons, and next horizon.

## Historical Boundary

- Pre-adoption versions: `v0.2.0` through `v0.7.0`, recorded by Git tags and worklog entries.
- Process adoption: CV9.E5.
- First prospective major boundary: CV9 completion may become `v1.0.0`, because CV9 is the public-release readiness boundary for Mirror Mind 1.0.

Retroactive release notes may be added later as archival work, but they are not required for the process to operate from here forward.
