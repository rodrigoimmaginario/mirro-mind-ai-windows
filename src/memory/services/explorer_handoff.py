## What Changed Through Exploration

This section should preserve the evolution of the exploration: the original question, the meaningful pivots, the corrections that changed the story, and the current point of promotion. If this document was generated from a short runtime summary, Builder should ask the Navigator whether more conversation evidence must be folded in before roadmap work starts.

## Handoff Completeness Checklist

{_render_completeness_checklist(story, source_conversations, includes_full_conversation)}

## What Builder Should Preserve

- The exploration is not only a feature request. It carries discovery context and product judgment.
- The attractor and experiment proposal should guide Builder's first roadmap framing.
- The product design proposal should be translated into roadmap/story docs only after Builder reads the project.

## Risks

- Builder may over-treat exploratory material as settled delivery scope.
- Builder may flatten open questions into implementation assumptions.
- Builder may focus on mechanism before preserving the user-facing product shape.

## Open Questions

- Which parts of this exploration should become roadmap stories?
- What validation route proves the product behavior externally?
- What should remain outside the first delivery slice?

## Boundaries

- This handoff is not a delivery plan.
- Builder must still read the project, create or update roadmap/story docs, and validate with the Navigator.
- Explorer preserved uncertainty; Builder should not erase it prematurely.

## Non-Assumptions

- Do not assume implementation architecture from this handoff.
- Do not assume all open questions are in scope.
- Do not assume the experiment proposal has already been validated.

## Attractors

{_render_attractors(story)}

## Experiment Status

{_render_experiment(story)}

## Promotion Boundary

Builder executes only after explicit confirmation from the Navigator.

## Product Intent

{summary or story.narrative_field_summary or "_No product intent summary recorded._"}

## User-Facing Behavior

{story.current_exploratory_story or "_No current story recorded._"}

## What The Product Should Feel Like

The product should preserve the exploratory shape discovered by Explorer Mode. It should show the user what is happening at the product level, not expose implementation mechanics first.

## Interaction Flow

- User works in Explorer Mode while uncertainty is still alive.
- Explorer surfaces story changes visibly.
- Explorer names attractors and proposes small experiments.
- Explorer proposes Builder handoff only when the user asks or confirms readiness.
- Builder begins only after explicit confirmation.

## Product-Level States

- Exploratory Story active.
- Attractor proposed or accepted.
- Experiment proposal proposed or accepted.
- Builder handoff proposed.

## Acceptance Behavior

- The user can understand what is being proposed without reading implementation details.
- The proposal preserves uncertainty and open questions.
- The proposal gives Builder enough product shape to create roadmap or story plans.

## Explicit Non-Goals

- This document does not define implementation architecture.
- This document does not create delivery tasks by itself.
- This document does not replace Builder planning.

## Open Product Questions

- Which behavior is necessary for the first delivery slice?
- What should remain exploratory after Builder starts?
- What user validation will prove the product behavior works?
